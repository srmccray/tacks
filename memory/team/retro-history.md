# Retrospective History

## Retro: 2026-02-25
- Tasks completed: 8 beads closed (+ tacks-5sl.20 already shipped with stats)
- New learnings: 22 across 3 members (core-dev: 8, bdd: 8, db: 8 counting seed + sprint)
- Pruned/archived: 0 entries (first session, no staleness)
- Key insight: Parallel dispatch across non-overlapping ownership areas (commands/tests/db) achieves zero conflicts and high throughput — all 6 agent dispatches succeeded first try
